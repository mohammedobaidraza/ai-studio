# 🧠 Agent Store  
*A home for useful, human-first AI agents*

---

## Why Agent Store exists

AI agents are everywhere right now.

But most of them feel like:
- demos that never shipped  
- tools nobody actually uses  
- abstractions nobody explains  

**Agent Store exists to fix that.**

This is a curated place for **real, practical AI agents** — built by humans, for humans — that solve actual problems.  
No hype. No fluff. Just agents that *do things*.

## What is Agent Store?

Agent Store is a growing collection of AI agents you can:
- explore
- understand
- reuse
- extend
- deploy

Each agent is designed to be:
- **purpose-driven**
- **well-documented**
- **easy to plug into real workflows**

Think of it as:

> GitHub + App Store vibes, but for AI agents 🤖

---

## What makes this different?

Most AI repos answer **“what can AI do?”**  
Agent Store answers **“how do I actually use this?”**

Every agent here aims to:
- solve one clear problem
- explain *why* it exists
- show *how* it works
- be usable without a PhD in prompt engineering

---

## What you’ll find here

Agents may vary, but you’ll commonly see:
- 🔍 Research & analysis agents  
- 🛡️ Security & threat-detection agents  
- 📄 RAG / document intelligence agents  
- 🧠 Reasoning & decision-support agents  
- ⚙️ Automation & workflow agents  

Each agent lives in its own space with:
- clear intent
- setup instructions
- usage examples
- extension ideas

---

## Who this is for

If you are:
- a **developer** building AI-powered systems
- a **student** learning how agents actually work
- a **researcher** prototyping ideas fast
- a **builder** who wants usable tools, not demos

You’re in the right place.

## Design philosophy

Agent Store follows a few simple principles:

### 1. Humans first  
Agents should feel understandable, not magical.

### 2. Small > complicated  
One agent, one job. Clear scope.

### 3. Transparency over hype  
If something is experimental, we say so.

### 4. Built to extend  
Agents should be easy to remix, not locked boxes.

## Repository structure

While agents may differ, most follow a simple pattern:

```text
agent-name/
├── README.md        # What it does, why it exists
├── src/             # Core logic
├── prompts/         # System & task prompts
├── config/          # Settings, models, keys
└── examples/        # Real usage examples
